# leaflet-challenge

Regarding the legends, I used this website for a guide (https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/), as well as splicing some of the class files in regards to the css. However, I could not figure out getting the magnitude, location, and depth, probably due to exhaustion from other things. As such, any hints on where to look to fix this for resubmission would br appreciated.
